where

Methodology

The transformed data 
𝑧
z, obtained from Step-1, is used for parameter estimation. Since the given probability density function has a Gaussian-like form, its parameters can be estimated using basic statistical properties of the data.

First, the mean 
𝜇
μ is calculated as the average of all values of 
𝑧
z. This represents the central value of the distribution. Next, the variance of 
𝑧
z is computed to measure how the data is spread around the mean.

Using the variance, the parameter 
𝜆
λ is calculated as:

Finally, the normalization constant 
𝑐

These estimated values of
