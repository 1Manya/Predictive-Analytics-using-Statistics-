Discussion

In this assignment, the main objective was to deal with the issue of class imbalance in the credit card dataset. Since the number of fraud transactions was very low compared to normal transactions, the dataset was first converted into a balanced class dataset. This helped the machine learning models learn patterns from both classes more effectively.

After balancing the data, different sampling techniques were applied to create multiple samples. These samples were then used to train various machine learning models, and their performance was compared using accuracy. The results showed that sampling plays an important role in improving model performance, especially when working with imbalanced datasets.
